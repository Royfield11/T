### 2. Biodiversity Comparison:
- **Asia** will have greater biodiversity because it has a larger area compared to Antarctica. The species-area relationship indicates that larger areas tend to host a greater number of species due to higher habitat diversity, ecological niches, and resources available.

### A. Wallace's Conclusions on Life Forms:
Alfred Russel Wallace, a pioneering biogeographer, made several critical conclusions about life forms:
1. **Wallace's Line**: He proposed a biogeographical boundary (Wallace's Line) that separates the distinct faunal regions of Asia and Australasia, highlighting differences in species on either side of the line.
2. **Natural Selection**: Independently discovered the theory of natural selection, alongside Charles Darwin.
3. **Faunal Regions**: Identified and classified global regions based on species distribution, laying the groundwork for modern biogeography.
4. **Biodiversity Patterns**: Recognized patterns in species richness and distribution, linking them to geological and climatic factors.
